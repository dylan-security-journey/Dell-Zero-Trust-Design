## Zero Trust Implementation Roadmap

Waypoints define progressive phases toward creating technical foundation

Base waypoints are Discovery, Architecture Design, Architecture Optimization, Policy Design, and Implementation/Monitoring/Maintenance

Each phase contributes to building technical foundation that defines and establishes zero trust 

Technical Business Discovery: Data is gathered to estalish basline of existing security posture, business-related information collected, critical assets identified to know what needs to be protected, (active/iterative), up-to-date

Zero Trust Architecture Design: Defining procedures necessary to migrate organization to new security posture, detailed inputs, key stakeholders to design and understand scope

Architecture Optimization: Detailed scheme for maturity journal, identify resources to be protected and security architecture implemented
    
Policy Design: Map and catalog asset operational interdependencies, what conditions they may need access, least privilege

Zero Trust Implementation: policies deployed to establish and enforce, cyclical process

Monitoring & Maintenance:  ensures implementation remain effective, diagnosis, troubleshooting, updates

Policy design & Implementation & Maintenance  work together in periodic process, changes and fixes applied to existing or new policies

## Zero Trust Design Consideration

ZT architecture cannot be invincible as monitoring all users is more important and most protective

Effective controls rely on specific capabilities in pillar model

User: human and nonhuman identities

Device: all endpoints with local/remote access

Application & Workload: Resources bridge gap between users and organization's data

Data: Sensitive data that can create harm if misused or compromised

Network: Provides poath and maintains connection between endpoints and applications

Environment: IT environment provide data processing resources for applications and workloads

## Zero Trust Policy & Design Consideration

Design and policy driven approach and support them by establishing trust with devices and applications in environment, enforce least privilege, continuously verify, respond to change rapidly for potential incidents

## Zero Trust User Pillar Design Consideration

User Inventory: Authorized user list and audited user identities list

Conditional User Access: capture user status changes

Multi-Factor Authentication: User behaving normally, gather intel on centralized identity, 

Priviledged Access Management: Access automation engine 

Identity Federation User Credentialing: Seven laws of Identity: User control and consent, minimal disclosure, justification, directed identity, competition, human integration, consistency, SAML-based (Security Assertion Markup Language)

Behavioral, Contextual ID, and Biometrics: Sending detailed alerts, isolating threats, right policies based on unique environment needs

Least Privileged Access: Access policies for end-to-end enterprise identity

Continuous Authentication: tracking data points and typing pattern enrolled to verify identity 

Integrated ICAM Platform: Defining requirements for identification and authentication

## Zero Trust Device Pillar Design Considerations

Device Inventory: complete endpoint inventory, where it is located

Device Detection and Compliance: track and identify each device and how they communicate 

Device Authorization with Real-time Inspection: application control and file integrity monitoring

Remote Access: specify limits of allowed device activity, limit BYOD

Automated Asset, Vulnerability, and Patch Management: Automatically apply patches and recommend remediation

Unified Endpoint Management and Mobile Device Management:  UEM solution showing insights on device usage

Endpoint and Extended Detection and Response (EDR/XDR): identify suspicious activity and automated responses on predetermined triggers

## Zero Trust Application and Workload Pillar Design Consideration

Application Inventory: (APM) how applications integrate with each other

Secure Software Development and Integration: Application security become part of their workflow

Software Risk Management: (BOM), approved vulnerability databases 

Resource Authorization and Integration: User request gateway to route appropriate authentication, API manage sessions

Continuous Monitoring and Authorizations: (FISMA) (ATO) authorization to operate,
