## Zero Trust Implementation Roadmap

Waypoints define progressive phases toward creating technical foundation

Base waypoints are Discovery, Architecture Design, Architecture Optimization, Policy Design, and Implementation/Monitoring/Maintenance

Each phase contributes to building technical foundation that defines and establishes zero trust 

Technical Business Discovery: Data is gathered to estalish basline of existing security posture, business-related information collected, critical assets identified to know what needs to be protected, (active/iterative), up-to-date

Zero Trust Architecture Design: Defining procedures necessary to migrate organization to new security posture, detailed inputs, key stakeholders to design and understand scope

Architecture Optimization: Detailed scheme for maturity journal, identify resources to be protected and security architecture implemented

Policy Design: Map and catalog asset operational interdependencies, what conditions they may need access, least privilege

Monitoring & Maintenance:
