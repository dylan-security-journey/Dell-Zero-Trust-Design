## Zero Trust Implementation Roadmap

Waypoints define progressive phases toward creating technical foundation

Base waypoints are Discovery, Architecture Design, Architecture Optimization, Policy Design, and Implementation/Monitoring/Maintenance

Each phase contributes to building technical foundation that defines and establishes zero trust 

Technical Business Discovery: Data is gathered to estalish basline of existing security posture, business-related information collected, critical assets identified to know what needs to be protected, (active/iterative), up-to-date

Zero Trust Architecture Design: Defining procedures necessary to migrate organization to new security posture, detailed inputs, key stakeholders to design and understand scope

Architecture Optimization: Detailed scheme for maturity journal, identify resources to be protected and security architecture implemented
    
Policy Design: Map and catalog asset operational interdependencies, what conditions they may need access, least privilege

Zero Trust Implementation: policies deployed to establish and enforce, cyclical process

Monitoring & Maintenance:  ensures implementation remain effective, diagnosis, troubleshooting, updates

Policy design & Implementation & Maintenance  work together in periodic process, changes and fixes applied to existing or new policies

## Zero Trust Design Consideration
