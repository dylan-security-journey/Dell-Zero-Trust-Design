## What is Zero Trust?

Zero trust is a dynamic methodology, moves defense from static (network-based perimters) to focus on users/assets/resources, assumes no implicit trust is granted to users/assets

Never trust, always verify, have zero trust in a digital system, explicit control of their IT environment

## Importance  of Zero Trust

Evolution of the Perimeter: Security has expanded beyond enterprise network, lots of data/application moving outside network causing dynamic situation where attacks can come from inside & outside the network

Perimeter-based defenses that are traditional like VPNs, DMZs, Firewalls, ACL's are no longer sufficient in modern environments (Data centers are susceptible to lateral movements like VLAN hopping even if internal traffic is segmented)

Fragmented Security Policies and Tools: complex vendor landscapes and supply chain require more streamlined approach to security, traditional security models use siloed approach to threat prevention, security tools misconfigured

Policies not well defined, increase cost in hardware and overhead, limitied visibility, critical to define and enforce security policies across organization

Evolving Threat Landscape: Moving target, increase in attack frequency & sophistication, AI adoption leads to more concerns with data poisoning/privacy leakage, target all data/valuables, complex layers of IT like IaaS, SaaS, Paas and number of devices

Shift Towards Remote and Hybrid Workforce: Mobile workforce from anywhere, unsecured wifi networks, no longer verified/controlled, BYOD (Bring your own Device), employees forget basic hygiene skills and using their devices to access work networks

## Traditional Security vs. Zero Trust

Traditional Security: VPNs, Trust but verify (bad guys outside firewall and good guys inside firewall)

Zero Trust: Focus on users, assets, and resources (whether internal or external, continuously verified)

## How Does Zero Trust Work?

Ensures that (DAAS) data, application, asset, and services is protected with security capabilities that move along protect surface, provides zones for visibility (secure, manage, monitor)

Verify Explicitly: Always verify users and network requests regardless of location or access history (does not matter if you had access before) (trusted until proven otherwise)

Use least priviledged access: Limit user access to resources they absolutely need for current role, access is granular and per session

Assume Breach: Segmnet user access, encryption, continuously monitor and strengthen defenses 

## Benefits of Zero Trust

Prevent unauthorized access: adaptive identity-based access control, continuously verify aand authenticate regardless of location or time (role based and attribute based)

Reduce the impact radius: Mitigates most attack vectors and surface due to 'trust none' policy, can't pivot freely within network

Enhance response effectiveness: Automate and orchestrate security response quickly, not to overlook anything

Curb freedom of movement: focused on priviledged access management to control how it's used and revoked

Avoid too many on-ranmps: 'comply to connect' limits employees to log into sensitive systems on a unsecure network

Minimize operational risk: systems not being patched, automation of updates

## Application Areas of Zero Trust

Multicloud: 

Containerized Software & Micro-services: containers isolated but share resources, assigns identity to every service instance                                                                                             

Internet-of-Things: new devices accessing the network, varying levels of trust

5G/6G: Data transfer rate increase

Varied Access needs: temporary user access, given access to only resources needed

Cross-enterprise collaboration: Enroll in federated ID management system

Remote work/mobile management: most organizations support remote workforce
