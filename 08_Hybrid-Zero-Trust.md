## Hybrid Zero Trust Implementation

Porous perimeter > detect underlying vulnerabilites

New entry points > disrupt operations

Economic impact to organization

Hybrid Zero Trust: upgrading and adding new technologies to existing environment, re-purpose existing security solutions, standard components adaptable in hybrid control environment

## Implementation of Hybrid Zero Trust

Risk Management Framework (RMF): creating access policies centered on acceptance risk, accepted or removed

Assessment: Proper assessment needs to be done to understand inventories and proccesses to be created, need to know current state

Risk Asssessment and Policy Development: Identified risk and potential severity, evaluation process of singular (each request), contextual (recent history) or hybrid (combo of both), classified as criteria based and scire based (qualified attributes)

Deployment: Device agent or gateway-based deployment, enclaved based, device application sandboxing and resource portal

Operation and Expansion: begin plamning of next phase and monitor logs and feedback from stakeholders

Change/Upgrade Migration Feedback: Updating and maintenance, business processes evaluation conducted

## Considerations for Hybrid Zero Trust

Assets: high value assets, capabilities around assets, asset management

Actors: how are priviliges assigned, blanket permissions, behavior patter

Process: tradeoff in performance, sata flows identified, approval and denied

Vendors or Solutions: is it compatible with infrastructure, consistent visibility, securit expert supports for employee training

## Introduction

Integration of multiple exist technologies of various maturities, certain vendors more suited for specific processes, vendors switched if can't meet SLA or compliance requirements

## Assessment Template or Evaluation for Vendor Assessment

Pillars alignment, cost, compatbility, Usability & features, Vendor score = weight x vendor evaluation

## Considerations for Vendor Selection

Pillars alignment: Align with zero trust pillars? target level or advanced level?

Cost: cost involved? affordable? advantages and disadvantages of adoption?

Usability and features: user-friendly? security features supported?

## Pillar Alignment

User: protect users using network?

Devices: isolate and protect every device?

Network: solution enable network segmentation?

Application & Workload: Does it portect applications?

Data: Ensure dat categorization?

Automation & Orchestration: Automate zero trust principles?

Visibility & Analytics: Useful analytics and data points provided?

## Pillars Alignment: Metric

How many pillars supported & level of capabilities?

Pillar Alignment & Capabilities Support: Low-High Range

Value: 0-3

Description: support zero, one, two, more than two & target level or advanced level

## Total Cost

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) = One time cost + ongoing cost x number of years

One time cost: initial implementation and planning cost

Ongoing cost: number of security controls, time duration of project
