## Introduction to Tenets

Organizations don't have to implement zero trust all at once, respond to increased complexity in digital transformation areas

Systems follow key principles of Zero Trust to address: 
-The increase in multi-cloud systems
-Use of unmanaged devices to access corporate resources
-Need to support legacy and modern applications
-Rise of ransomware and supply chain attacks

Tenets of ZT help guide creation of ZT Architecture

## Tenets of Zero Trust

Tents are considered ideal goal for strategy, US DOD documents five major tenets

Assume a hostile environment: Malicious personas inside and outside environment treated as untrusted

Presume breach: Operating with assumption that adversary presence is within your environment

Never trust, always verify: least privilege & by default access is denied

Scrutinize explicitly: Access to resources is conditional (confidence levels)

Apply unified analytics: (DAAS) understand behavior and log interactions
