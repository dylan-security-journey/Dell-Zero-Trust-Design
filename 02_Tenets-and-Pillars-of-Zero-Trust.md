## Introduction to Tenets

Organizations don't have to implement zero trust all at once, respond to increased complexity in digital transformation areas

Systems follow key principles of Zero Trust to address: 
-The increase in multi-cloud systems
-Use of unmanaged devices to access corporate resources
-Need to support legacy and modern applications
-Rise of ransomware and supply chain attacks

Tenets of ZT help guide creation of ZT Architecture

## Tenets of Zero Trust

Tents are considered ideal goal for strategy, US DOD documents five major tenets

Assume a hostile environment: Malicious personas inside and outside environment treated as untrusted

Presume breach: Operating with assumption that adversary presence is within your environment

Never trust, always verify: least privilege & by default access is denied

Scrutinize explicitly: Access to resources is conditional (confidence levels)

Apply unified analytics: (DAAS) understand behavior and log interactions

## Overview of the Zero Trust Pillars

Pillars provide deeper understanding of where/why/how security measures implemented, focus areas of targets, guide organizations

Stages of Security: Traditional, Intitial, Advanced, Optimal

User Identity: focuses on user identification and access control policies, securing/limitng access to data, continuously validated, high levels of identity security

Devices: Health and status of devices, system of record validated user-control, ensure proper use of authorized devices, monitoring and enforcing health and compliance of devices, endpoint security, patch management

Applications & Workloads: Focuses on protecting applications, VM, hypervisors, prevent unauthorized access

Data: focuses on data security/integrity understand Device-as-a-Service, data inventory management, data encryption

Network & Environment: Focus on segmenting networks with granular policies & access control and isolating, define network acess, microsegmentation

Automation & Orchestration: Automated security and operations in deployment, AI technique, manual security process to be eliminated, SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response) (API standardization = Application Programming interfaces)

Visibility & Analytics: insight into users and system behavior, detect divergences, entity behavior analytics, (SIEM)

## Mapping Zero Trust Capabilities to Pillars

45 capabilities align with the seven pillars, Capabilities are further divided and organized into 152 ZT activities

## Pillars, Resources, and Capability Mapping

Mapping out allow for operational view of implementation, how it all works together

Enterprise Identity Service: Automatic Account Provisioning (AAP), Enterprise Federated Identity Service (FEIS), Master User Record (MUR)

Automation & Orchestration Pillar: Cyberseurity Domain Orchestrator, Cybersecurity DOmain Controller Policy Engine & Automation / (SOAR), Representative Capabilities (Software-Defined Enterprise & Cybersecurity Orchestration)

Visibility & Analytics Pillar: Analytics & Confident Scoring, Logging/SIEM, Representative capabilities (Analytics, Auditing, Sensor & Telemetry)

Policy Enforcement Points

Client & Identity Assurance

User (Person Entity): Authentication decision point, continuous authentication or conditional (NPEs, M2M), services (ICAM)

Devices (Non-person entity, PC/Phone/IoT): Authentication decision point, device hygiene, comply to connect

Data Centric Enterprise

Network & Infrastructure Pillar: Resource authorization decision point, ZT enabling infrastructure

Application & Workload Pillar: Application authorization decision point, securing applications/workloads, supply chain

Data pillar: Data authorization decision point, securing data, data discovery, data masking
