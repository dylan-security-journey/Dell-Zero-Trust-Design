## Introduction to Zero Trust in Networks

Zero Trust Network (ZTN) implement context-aware policies to athorize access, network presumed hostile, vulnerable to both interal and external, network locality insufficient to trust, authenticated and authorized, policies should be adaptive

## Zero Trust Network Techniques

key techniques include microsegmentation, access control, encryption, and data flow mapping

Microsegmenation: divides network up to prvent spread of lateral contamination through organization, granular and role-based access for unified policy enforcement, L4/L7 firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, sandboxing


Access Control: Determines who has access to data/applications dependenant on location/role/attributes

Encryption: Encodes data and makes it unreadable to hackers, secure data in use and at rest or transit, data in-flight encryption provided by SSL (Secure Socket Layer)

Data Flow Mapping: Flow of data routes and it's location 

## What is Zero Trust Network Access?

(ZTNA) creates identity-based and context-based around applications, masks network location (IP address) 

## Features of ZTNA

context-aware by time or geographic location

continual verification, handle real-time dynamic policies based on user behavior, protect all business application, centralized management, identify applications depending on APP-IDs, extended detection and response

## Why ZTNA?

Exposed IP Address: VPN/firewalls exposes entire network

Layered Security Approach: seamless and well integrated 

Distributed Access Controls: pn-premises and off-premises (cloud scenarios)

Authentication & Privilege Access Management: verify identity and provid access capabilities beyond standard user (MFA), minimum neccessary to perform activities

## Benefits of Zero trust Network Access

Creates Virtual Overlay Network: IP addresses never exposed on internet (encrypted)

Elevates End-User Experience: access cloud and private applications, fast direct access

Improved Data Protection: enforced policies (DLP) Data Loss Prevention, regardless of where data is in

Improved Security Network Visibility: monitor from centralized dashboard, who is using what

Protect the Remote Workforce: Firewalls/porxies/DMZs not enough, security principles additional layer of protection

Avoid Lateral Movements: software-defined perimeters, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
