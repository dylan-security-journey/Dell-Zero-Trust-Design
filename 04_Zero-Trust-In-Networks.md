## Introduction to Zero Trust in Networks

Zero Trust Network (ZTN) implement context-aware policies to athorize access, network presumed hostile, vulnerable to both interal and external, network locality insufficient to trust, authenticated and authorized, policies should be adaptive

## Zero Trust Network Techniques

key techniques include microsegmentation, access control, encryption, and data flow mapping

Microsegmenation: divides network up to prvent spread of lateral contamination through organization, granular and role-based access for unified policy enforcement, L4/L7 firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, sandboxing


Access Control: Determines who has access to data/applications dependenant on location/role/attributes

Encryption: Encodes data and makes it unreadable to hackers, secure data in use and at rest or transit, data in-flight encryption provided by SSL (Secure Socket Layer)

Data Flow Mapping: Flow of data routes and it's location
