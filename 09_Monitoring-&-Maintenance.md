## Visibility and Zero Trust

Relies heavily on network data and access to data in transit, comprehensive view of scenarios for confirmation of behavior with permitted preset values (EDR), validate EDR output simultaneously

## Need of Visibility

Visibility analytics and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) necessary

Help detection and mitigation of threats (dashboard), enable elimination of blind spots (charts), enable organizations to perform risk mitigation and deliver enhanced experience (automation-driven), collect logs from all possible sources (real-time detection), allow creation of customized dashboards

## Steps in Collection and Visualization of Zero Trust Environment Data

Aggregation of data (collect) > Cleaning of Data (consistent structure) > Supplement Data (correlate) > Augment Data (context) > Visualization/Reporting/Analytics
