## Introduction to Visibility & Analytics

Visibility: track what data they have, where it resides, how it travels, aggregation of contextual and behavioral analytics provide greater understanding (dashboards, logging, alerts, asset inventory)

Analytics: turn volume of data into meaningful information, query data to make correlations or find patterns to describe an event, (trend graphing, traffic reporting, data utilization, reporting)

## Visibility and Zero Trust

Relies heavily on network data and access to data in transit, comprehensive view of scenarios for confirmation of behavior with permitted preset values (EDR), validate EDR output simultaneously

## Need of Visibility

Visibility analytics and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) necessary

Help detection and mitigation of threats (dashboard), enable elimination of blind spots (charts), enable organizations to perform risk mitigation and deliver enhanced experience (automation-driven), collect logs from all possible sources (real-time detection), allow creation of customized dashboards

## Steps in Collection and Visualization of Zero Trust Environment Data

Aggregation of data (collect) > Cleaning of Data (consistent structure) > Supplement Data (correlate) > Augment Data (context) > Visualization/Reporting/Analytics

## Analytics and Zero Trust

Increase in data arise opportunities and challenges

capacity to process telemetry data, real-time apporach, more accurate detection, rapid identification, greater real-time visibility

## How is Analytics Applied in Zero Trust?

Determining context using data from device/user/application, statistics and confidence scores that increment irregularities, score used to define alerts and likelihood, real-time visibility into threat landscape

## Example of Risk based Alerting for Zero Trust

Analytics & Confidence Scoring: analyzes logs and events to obtain confidence scores = score used to indicate probability of event being true

## Features and Functionality of Visibility & Analytics

No such thing as one size fits all

Secure Segmentation and connectivity: segmenting and isolating provide an intuitive policy wizard for defining micro segmentation

Remote Monitoring: Ensure user/devices only have access to entitled remote access controls from analyzing SIEM  and end-point detection systems

IT Management: Categorize networks, servers, and services according to risk

Fraud and Threat Hunting: Inform potential risk utilizing (UEBA), situational awareness

Risk Monitoring: Reveals and generates alerts in case of abnormal processes with spikes in usage

Network Packet Brokers for Visibility and Security: TAPs and NPBs leverage maximize utilization through load balancing and packet filtering

## Establish Visibility

Discover: Identify all applications/data/devices, centralized policy inventory, trusted inventory list, confirm risk appetite

Define: Visibility for admins to create and assign roles, confidence scoring, create baseline, asset ID and alert correlation, define encryption methods

Enforce: how they interact, configure automatic detection, reassert microsegmentation, enforce log parsing and log analysis, refine policies

Monitoring: Continuously adapt  and trigger automated risk-response, update security profiles

## Examples for Establishing Visibility

User device and data captured upon attempting request, ML model work out the risk score by searching odd conduct, conveys to policy engine, engine compares risk score to compliances to determine request to be allowed or denied

## Role of Networking Performance Monitoring (NPM) and Deep Packet Monitoring (DPM) in Visibility

Networking Performance Monitoring: monitoring of nework packets, only record metadata and carry with low load (differentiate normal traffic from abnormal traffic)

Deep Packet Monitoring: examines packets at more granular level than NPM, checks payload of every data packet

## Considerations for Implementing Visibility

1) Network port limitations

2) Single dashboard to monitor

3) Only relevant traffic flows to analysis tool

4) NPM,DPM, or TAPs introduce latency

5) easy to integrate across infrastructure

6) dashboard tools should be flexible to support analytic work

7) Care should be taken when designing data flows

8) Data storage taken into account

9) Harmonized and aggregated volume of data

10) supporting scalability and segmentation

11) technical staff with training on tools

## Best Practices for Establishing Visibility

Ensure Integrity of Data: focus on monitoring and preserving the health of devices

Constantly enhance security by collecting data from multiple sources: further develop state of security through research and gathering information

Agile policy and restricted access: adaptability to developing requirements

Confirm that all the communication and processes related to security are visibile: crucial insights into behavior
